        I''m thinking about sending one of my Indonesian employees to the piccadilly

        No, I don''t know what you mean. What do you do for a living? I''m a skydiver.

        That''s a lie.

        How is that a lie? Do you want me to send you a picture of my snake?

        Do you have a big black snake?

        No, but I do have a pet python. Do you own any pets?

        I had all my pets poisoned.

        Oh, I''m so sorry to hear that. What kind of pets do you have now?

        Dead ones.'

        It is going well. How are you? I just got back from cooking. I love to cook!

        I really enjoy cooking italian food. What about you? What do you like to do?

        I don''t like Italian food very much. It''s nasty.

        I''m sorry to hear that. Have you ever been to italy? I would love to go one
        day.

        Are you sure you can afford it with your shitty salary?

        I''m sure I can. I just have to save up. Do you have any hobbies?

        I like to people watch. I have a good time making fun of them. Do you?

        Yes, I love to make fun of people. It makes me feel better about my own shortcomings.

        Yes! This is totally inappropriate behavior.
